There are two programs used to webscrape, “cpso_webscraper_active.py” and “cpso_webscraper_inactive.py”. Both programs used python and a package called selenium which required a chrome driver for your OS. Due to the interaction requirements of the website, it was most simple to just emulate a chrome browser to automatically interact with the website to download the right files. The program runs an empty search from the advanced search URL, then there will be two functions that it runs. The “search_results_function” works on single doctor pages, it will use the “click view more” button to show additional locations, as well as the “view corporation” button to show corporation information Then the program will save the page as a plain .txt files with the CPSO number as the file name. The “scroll_pages” function works by going through the entire results, 5 pages at a time for all several thousand results. The “find_page” function was used to go to a certain page if there was an interruption in the running of the program, usually it would take a value from the last page of the previous run of the program.

The “cpso_webscraper_inactive.py” program worked very similarly, with the exception of unclicking the active doctors setting and clicking the inactive doctors setting for the advance search. Otherwise it would work and run the same way as the active program.
